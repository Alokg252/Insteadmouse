# Insteadmouse
control your mouse using your keyboard

insteadMouse.py and m.py both does the same thing but there's a extra feature in m.py
Once you run the m.py then its copied in your user file and as its result you can run
m.py anytime just press Windows key + R Enter m.py and Hit the Enter button and m.py
will start working no need to find and run the file everytime.

its all written with built-in modules of python
